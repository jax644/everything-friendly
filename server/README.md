Welcome to "Everything-Friendly"!

This app is built for people with dietary restrictions who want to enjoy modified versions of their favorite recipes.

As a user, you can enter the details of a recipe, or simply link to a recipe URL, and recieve a new version of the recipe that accommodates your dietary needs.

Everything-Friendly is powered by Julian Poyourow's "RecipeSage" recipe parser and Claude's Anthropic AI.
